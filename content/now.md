What am I doing now?

I am working at [Synoa GmbH](https://synoa.de) doing DevOps, AWS, and Front-End development.

Otherwise I am:

- learning [Go](https://golang.org/) in my free time, see [some code on GitHub](https://github.com/kevingimbel?utf8=%E2%9C%93&tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=go)
- playing [Paladins - Champions of the Realm](https://www.paladins.com/) on PS4
- learning Spanish with Duolingo (Â¡Yo hablo espaÃ±ol, pero no mucho! ðŸ˜¬)

Inspired by [NowNowNow.com](http://nownownow.com/)
