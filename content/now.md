What am I doing now?

I am working at [Synoa GmbH](https://synoa.de) as a Full-Stack Developer with a main focus on Front-End Development.

Otherwise I am:

- learning [Go](https://golang.org/) in my free time, see [some code on GitHub](https://github.com/kevingimbel?utf8=%E2%9C%93&tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=go)
- playing Stardew Valley on Switch
- helping to develop and maintain [fakedata](https://github.com/lucapette/fakedata), a CLI utility to generate data
