<h1>Hi, I'm Kevin Gimbel</h1>
<h2>I'm a Full-Stack Developer with a strong focus on Front-End Development</h2>
<p>I like video games and love all kinds of art, from traditional pantings to modern urban art. Art has always been a part of my life, either active or passive.</p>
<p>I used to be an active (hobby) photographer and took a lot of pictures. I still do on-the-go, you can find them on <a href="https://instagram.com/kevingimbel" title="My Instagram Profile where I share images">Instagram</a> or <a href="https://eyeem.com/kevingimbel" title="My EyeEm profile where I share my favorites and sell photographs">EyeEm</a>. You can buy some via EyeEm, too!</p>
