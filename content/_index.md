<h1>Hi, I'm Kevin Gimbel</h1>
<h2>I'm a Full-Stack Developer with a strong focus on Front-End Development</h2>
<p>I like video games and love all kinds of art, from traditional pantings to modern urban art. Art has always been a part of my life, either active or passive.</p>

<h2>I love Photography!</h2>
<p>I used to be an active (hobby) photographer and took a lot of pictures. I mostly do on-the-go or travel photography these days and I tent to sell the "better once" (that it, the once <i>I</i> really like) on EyeEm. You can visit my <a href="https://eyeem.com/kevingimbel" title="My EyeEm profile where I share my favorites and sell photographs">EyeEm profile</a> to buy them.</p>
