Hey! My name is Kevin Gimbel and I am a Full-Stack Developer at [Synoa GmbH](https://synoa.de). I enjoy good ~~tea~~ ~~coffee~~ tea and coffee and like to play video games or go to concerts.

### So Far

I used to take a lot of photographs when I was younger and even worked a bit as photographer. During this time I got interested in building websites. While taking photographs I build portfolios for myself and got deeper into Development - especially Front-End Development. The photography faded away (sadly), but the Development stuck with me and since 2014 I am employed at [Synoa GmbH](http://synoa.de "Data Architects"), building Front-Ends, Magento Modules, and custom JavaScript solutions for our clients. As the only Front-End Developer I am responsible for all things Front-End related: Responsive Design/Development, Cross-browser compatibility, choosing technologies and frameworks, implementing custom features, and so on - you name it. I am also responsible for DevOps/"SysAdmin" related things like getting Docker Containers running or managing servers and software.

### <3
I'm a proud member of team [bullgit](https://bullg.it "See the bullgit website"), a international group of developers from all over the world, ranging from India to America - we're here to serve the finest of uselessness. [Tim](https://twitter.com/TimPietrusky) and me even did two talks about bullgit on two meetups here in Germany.

### Everything else
In my free time I enjoy some good games, mostly playing on consoles. I'm also a big fan of concerts and music which is why I enjoy being at concerts every now and then. I build an "App" called [LinedUp](https://github.com/kevingimbel/LinedUp) to collect all concerts I have been to, you can see a working example with concerts I've been to on [concerts.kevingimbel.me](https://concerts.kevingimbel.me) (the list is by all means not complete yet!).
