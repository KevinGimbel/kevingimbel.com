What am I doing now?

I am working at [Synoa GmbH](https://synoa.de) as a Front-End and PHP Developer. I also focus on tooling in bash and [DevOps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps).

Otherwise I am:

- continuing to learn [Go](https://golang.org/) in my free time, see [some code on GitHub](https://github.com/kevingimbel?utf8=%E2%9C%93&tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=go)
- play [recore](http://amzn.to/2i5E9o0)
- cooking almost every day, see it on [Snapchat](https://snapchat.com/add/kevinatari)
- learning [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) by using it
