Arr.js extends the JavaScript Array Object by providing a set of custom functions.

Arr.js is mostly a learning-project. I've learned quite a bit about handling arrays and using Prototype (not the framework) while creating it. It's by all means not meant to be used in any kind of production environment. There's a [doc page](https://kevingimbel.github.io/arr-js/doc/arr.js.html) available.
