If you wish to contribute you can do so. Contributions can be anything from opening an Issue to actually fixing code.
To build the site locally you first need to [install Hugo](https://gohugo.io/overview/installing/) as well as [Go](https://golang.org/dl/). Next you need to clone the repository to your local machine with git by running `git clone https://github.com/kevingimbel/kevingimbel.com.git`. Once the process is finised go into the new directory and run Â `hugo serve $(pwd)` to start hugo with live reload.
